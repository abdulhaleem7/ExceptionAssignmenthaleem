An exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program
. A C# exception is a response to an exceptional circumstance that arises
 while a program is running,
 such as an attempt to divide by zero.
Exceptions provide a way to transfer control from one part 
of a program to another. C# exception handling is built upon 
four keywords: try, catch, finally, and throw.
Assuming a block raises an exception,
 a method catches an exception using a combination
of the try, catch and finally keywords.
